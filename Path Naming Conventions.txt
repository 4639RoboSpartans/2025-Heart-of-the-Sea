Paths for use in competitions start with "COMP-"
Otherwise, start with "TEST-"

Reef sides are designated as follows:
A, B are on the side facing DS, A on left, B on right
Going counter-clockwise from A and B, each of the 2 branches on each face has its own letter

    GH
  IJ  EF
  KL  CD
    AB
    DS

Full path examples:
COMP-A-B-C
TEST-I-L-H-C

We can assign scoring heights to the auton in code, so heights are unneeded when naming paths.
When naming paths in code, add the heights after each location
For example:
A4, C2, L1, etc.

COMP-A4-B4-C3
